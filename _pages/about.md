Hi! I'm Hesam Sheikh Hassani, a last year master's student at the university of Bologna. I am self-motivated, with proven skill-set, plus teamwork experience and communication skills. [Get my CV here](https://hesamsheikh.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). I write technical articles on the latest ML breakthroughs and explore AI to learn by sharing. [See my Blog section](https://hesamsheikh.github.io/blog/).

My interest lies in a broad landscape of Machine Learning, including:
- Large Language Models 
- ML & Computer Vision
- ML Research 
- AI interpretability 

I find the various fields of AI just as much exciting, since they boil down to the same principles. I also find excitement in interdisciplinary applications of AI in other fields, such as healthcare, physics, finance, and advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).
