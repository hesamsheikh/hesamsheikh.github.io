Hi! I'm Hesam Sheikh Hassani, a last year master's student at the university of Bologna. [Get my CV here](https://hesamsheikh.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf) I write technical articles on the latest ML breakthroughs and explore aspects of AI to learn by sharing. [See my Blog section](https://hesamsheikh.github.io/blog/) 

My interest lies in the broad landscape of Machine Learning, including:
- ML, NLP, LLM
- the intersection of ML and Computer Vision
- ML research
- AI interpretability 

To me, the various use-cases and aspects of AI are just as much exciting as they boil down to the same principles. I also find excitement in interdisciplinary applications of AI in other fields, such as healthcare, physics, finance, and advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS).
